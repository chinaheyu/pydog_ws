Some scripts that may make your life a bit easier when post-processing openFoam simulations.

paraview.py automates the paraview step (unsurprisingly) of the usual GADEN workflow. 
In order to use it, you might need to modify your pythonpath environment variable to include the paraview site-packages (wherever those are in your system).
Usage is:
    python paraview.py path/to/file.foam path/to/output/folder [-d]
    The optional -d flag is to mark that the project should be open as a decomposed case. I you don't know if your is, check wether it has multiple "processorN" subfolders. If it does have them, it is decomposed.

Now, depending on the paraview version you are using, the names of the output files might look like "file0.1.csv" instead of "file_1.csv". That is a problem for the gaden_preprocessing node.
To correct it, use the batch_rename.sh script. 
Usage:
 ./batch_rename.sh path/to/wind_fle/folder
